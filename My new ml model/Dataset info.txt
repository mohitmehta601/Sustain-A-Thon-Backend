ðŸ“‘ Dataset Documentation â€“ Edited Verified & Enriched Agricultural Dataset
1. Overview

This dataset contains 5110 rows and 21 columns, covering environmental, soil, crop, and fertilizer recommendation parameters for precision agriculture in India.
It was verified and enriched using trusted agricultural sources, with corrections for missing values, fertilizer recommendations, and soilâ€“nutrient linkages.

2. Structure
Columns

Temperature (Â°C) â€“ Air temperature at field

Humidity (%) â€“ Relative humidity

Moisture (%) â€“ Soil moisture

Soil_Type â€“ Soil classification (Sandy, Silty, Clay, Laterite, Alkaline, etc.)

Crop â€“ Crop type (Tea, Cotton, Maize, Groundnut, etc.)

Nitrogen (N) â€“ Soil nitrogen level (mg/kg)

Phosphorus (P) â€“ Soil phosphorus level (mg/kg)

Potassium (K) â€“ Soil potassium level (mg/kg)

pH â€“ Soil pH value

N_Status â€“ Nitrogen sufficiency (Low, Optimal, High)

P_Status â€“ Phosphorus sufficiency (Low, Optimal, High)

K_Status â€“ Potassium sufficiency (Low, Optimal, High)

Primary_Fertilizer â€“ Recommended main inorganic fertilizer

Secondary_Fertilizer â€“ Supplementary inorganic fertilizer (different from primary)

Organic_1 / Organic_2 / Organic_3 â€“ Recommended organic amendments

pH_Amendment â€“ Suggested soil amendment for pH correction (e.g., Lime, Sulphur, Gypsum, None)

_N_calc / _P_calc / _K_calc â€“ Backend-calculated nutrient sufficiency labels (for validation)

3. Sources Used for Verification & Enrichment

The dataset was cross-verified and enriched using multiple authoritative Indian and international sources, including:

Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) â€“ https://icar.org.in

Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) guidelines â€“ https://kvk.icar.gov.in

State Agricultural Universities (PAU, TNAU, IARI, etc.)

FAO Soil & Fertilizer Management Resources â€“ https://www.fao.org

Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Govt. of India â€“ https://agricoop.nic.in

Soil Health Card Scheme (India) â€“ https://soilhealth.dac.gov.in

International Fertilizer Association (IFA) â€“ https://www.fertilizer.org

Scientific journals and extension bulletins on nutrient management and fertilizer recommendations.

4. Notes

All fertilizer recommendations are regionally adapted for Indian conditions.

Secondary fertilizer was set to a different inorganic type than the primary, as per agronomic best practices.

Missing or invalid values like "-" or "â€”" were cleaned and replaced with verified entries.

Organic amendments were selected from widely used, sustainable practices.

5. Usage

This dataset is intended for:

Machine Learning models for fertilizer recommendation systems

Decision support tools for precision agriculture

Research in soil fertility and crop productivity

Farmer advisory platforms
